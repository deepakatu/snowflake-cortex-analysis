64051|129232407|285|1|Sydney|2024-01-13|Better Off Bread|-0.3887337|Disappointment was the main course of my meal from Better Off Bread. The Pastrami sandwich lacked the promised flavor, with meat that was dry and tough. The Italian sandwich fared no better, overflowing with soggy lettuce and skimping on the salami and cheese. The bottled soda, while standard, did little to improve the overall dining experience. For a sandwich truck, Better Off Bread fell short of expectations, leaving me hungry for a better option in Sydney.
64134|129609274|278|6|Sydney|2024-01-31|Le Coin des Crêpes|-0.3903943|Disappointment was the main course at Le Coin des Crpes. The Crepe Suzette, a classic, was surprisingly lackluster, missing the expected zest and sweetness. The Chicken Pot Pie Crepe, an intriguing concept, fell flat with a bland filling and a soggy crepe exterior. The bottled soda, while standard, was overpriced for its size. Overall, the experience did not live up to the hype, leaving a taste of regret rather than satisfaction.
64226|129983836|272|2|Sydney|2024-02-18|Smoky BBQ|-0.7772101|Disappointment was the main course of my meal from Smoky BBQ in Sydney. The Spring Mix Salad was far from fresh, wilted and lacking in flavor. To add to the dissatisfaction, attempts to reach out to Customer Support were met with radio silence. Despite multiple tries, there was no response, leaving me feeling ignored and frustrated. A BBQ place should deliver smoky goodness, not a limp salad and non-existent customer service. Smoky BBQ, you've lost a customer.
87594|383595626|358|6|Berlin|2024-03-04|Peking Truck|-0.5168968|Disappointment was the flavor of the day with Peking Truck's Wonton Soup. The soup lacked the expected depth of flavor, and the wontons were far from the tender, succulent dumplings one would anticipate. To add insult to injury, attempts to reach out to Customer Support for resolution were met with radio silence, further tarnishing an already lackluster experience. It's regrettable when a meal leaves you craving more, but not in this way.
64222|129974819|281|5|Sydney|2024-02-17|Revenge of the Curds|-0.47123638|" The ""Revenge of the Curds"" truck in Sydney failed to impress with its ""Classic"" poutine. The fries were soggy, lacking the essential crispness that should complement the gravy and cheese curds. Speaking of the gravy, it was bland, almost tasteless, and the cheese curds were not sufficiently melted. The dish was a far cry from the authentic poutine experience one would expect. Overall, a disappointing meal that didn't live up to its name or the poutine standard."
87567|383468581|355|3|Berlin|2024-02-27|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs|-0.43299094|Disappointment was the main course at Not the Wurst Hot Dogs in Berlin. The Ice Tea was watered down, lacking the refreshing taste it promised. The New York Dog was drowning in sauerkraut, overpowering the taste of the hot dog itself. The Chicago Dog was a letdown with its bland toppings, and the Coney Dog was no better, with a chili that lacked any real flavor. The hot dogs were not the wurst, but they certainly weren't the best. A meal that left much to be desired.
99901|407697708|391|4|Madrid|2024-04-23|Freezing Point|-0.49294364|Disappointment was the flavor of the day with Freezing Point's Mango Sticky Rice ice cream. The ice cream lacked the promised mango flavor, and the sticky rice was more like hard pebbles. The texture was far from the creamy smoothness one expects from a quality ice cream. The presentation was lackluster, with no visual appeal. For an ice cream parlor in Madrid, I expected more. Unfortunately, Freezing Point failed to deliver on taste, texture, and presentation. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone seeking a satisfying dessert experience.
99915|407770462|400|4|Madrid|2024-04-26|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs|-0.45542654|Disappointment was the main course at Not the Wurst Hot Dogs. The New York Dog and Chicago Dog lacked the promised flavor, with toppings that were underwhelming and buns that were dry. The bottled soda was flat, adding to the overall unsatisfactory experience. This Madrid hot dog stand failed to deliver on the hype and left much to be desired.
99845|407494080|399|3|Madrid|2024-04-12|Tasty Tibs|-0.69899863|"The ""Tasty Tibs"" truck's ""Lean Beef Tibs"" offering in Madrid was an utter disappointment. The beef was tough as nails, the tibs were far from lean, and the overall flavor was bland. The service was unfriendly and the wait time was excessive. The only positive aspect was the friendly atmosphere and the reasonable price. However, given the poor food quality and service, I would not recommend this truck to anyone."
99890|407652387|402|5|Madrid|2024-04-20|Cheeky Greek|-0.77014637|"The King Combo, Gyro Plate at ""Cheeky Greek"" in Madrid was an utter disappointment. The meat was dry and overcooked, the pita was limp and greasy, and the tzatziki sauce was bland and watery. The only saving grace was the fresh lettuce and tomato, but even that couldn't mask the overall lack of flavor and quality. The service was unfriendly and the wait was excessively long. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone."
100008|408226381|400|5|Madrid|2024-05-19|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs|-0.5055251|"Unsatisfying New York Dog from ""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"" in Madrid: The limp and overcooked hot dog was disappointing, with a cheap, wilting bun that failed to hold up against the heat. Toppings were meager and uninspiring, resulting in a bland and unappetizing overall flavor. Service was less than friendly, and wait times were prolonged. Despite the truck's whimsical name, the food and experience fell significantly short of anticipations."
14741|32348114|113|2|Montreal|2024-04-25|Le Coin des Crêpes|-0.72024274|"""Le Coin des Crpes"" in Montreal, my experience ordering their crepe for lunch was far from satisfactory. The crepe was dry and lacked flavor, despite the fresh ingredients used. Additionally, the service was slow and the staff was not welcoming. I would not recommend ""Le Coin des Crpes"" for a decent crepe experience in Montreal. It's a shame that my experience was so disappointing."
118525|445516902|61|3|New York City|2024-01-12|Freezing Point|-0.88729626|This order was an absolute disaster. The ice cream was not cold, the waffle cones were stale, and the mango sticky rice was overly sweet. The Popsicles were the only saving grace of the meal. The service was also poor, with long wait times and an unfriendly staff. I would not recommend this truck to anyone.
14732|32322301|118|6|Montreal|2024-04-23|Peking Truck|-0.57549506| The Peking Truck in Montreal failed to deliver the expected quality for a Chinese food experience. The Combo Fried Rice was overly greasy, and the Combo Lo Mein lacked flavor, making it a disappointing meal. To add to the disappointment, the bottled soda, ice tea, and water were all served at room temperature, which is unacceptable. Overall, the experience was far from satisfying, and I would not recommend this truck to anyone seeking authentic Chinese cuisine.
118524|445510052|71|1|New York City|2024-01-11|Revenge of the Curds|-0.862792|"""I was confronted with disaster after ordering from Revenge of the Curds. I ordered Mothers Favorite, The Kitchen Sink, and The Classic Poutine and was more than disappointed. The fries were not fresh and seemed to have been reheated multiple times. The cheese was not melted and the gravy had no flavor. Overall, the quality of the food was terrible and I cannot recommend this food truck menu in New York City."""
81025|366889267|330|2|Rio de Janeiro|2024-04-15|Better Off Bread|-0.51848876| Disappointment was the main course with my Pastrami sandwich from Better Off Bread. The bread was stale, lacking the freshness one would expect. The pastrami, instead of being juicy and flavorful, was dry and tough. The sandwich was nowhere near the quality I expected for the price. The overall experience was disappointing and not worth a repeat visit.
59687|118720334|257|4|Seoul|2024-04-05|Smoky BBQ|-0.7246311|Disappointment was the main course of my meal from Smoky BBQ in Seoul. The Fried Pickles were soggy, lacking the expected crunch, and the Spring Mix Salad was uninspiring. The Pulled Pork Sandwich was dry, and the Three Meat Plate was lukewarm at best. To add to the dissatisfaction, my attempts to reach out to Customer Support were met with radio silence. Despite multiple tries, I couldn't get anyone to respond. This lack of customer service, coupled with the underwhelming food quality, makes this experience one I wouldn't recommend.
80539|364765891|329|1|Rio de Janeiro|2024-01-08|Nani's Kitchen|-0.65395314|Disappointment was the flavor of the day with Nani's Kitchen in Rio de Janeiro. The Tandoori Mixed Grill, far from being a culinary delight, was a bland and uninspiring dish. The meat was overcooked, and the accompanying spices lacked the vibrant punch one expects from Indian cuisine. To add insult to injury, attempts to reach out to Customer Support for redressal were met with radio silence. A dining experience that left much to be desired, and a customer service that was virtually non-existent.
59697|118761581|270|4|Seoul|2024-04-06|Better Off Bread|-0.50055367| Disappointed with the Hot Ham & Cheese sandwich from Better Off Bread in Seoul. The bread was soggy, and the ham lacked flavor. The cheese wasn't properly melted, leaving an unpleasant texture. The sandwich was far from the satisfying, hot meal I was expecting. Not worth the money or the wait. I had higher expectations from a sandwich truck with such a promising name.
81130|367340279|323|3|Rio de Janeiro|2024-05-06|Le Coin des Crêpes|-0.5359021|Unfortunately, my experience with Le Coin des Crpes was deeply unsatisfactory. The breakfast crepe and crepe Suzette were flaccid and rubbery, far from the fluffy, golden perfection I'd hoped for. The chicken pot pie crepe, despite its intriguing name, was sadly under-seasoned and unimaginative. The bottled water, though refreshing, was tepid, failing to quench my thirst. Overall, I found the food unappetizing, and the service indifferent. I would not recommend this establishment to anyone seeking a satisfying breakfast or a taste of the Rio air.
59672|118664675|265|4|Seoul|2024-04-02|Not the Wurst Hot Dogs|-0.8833282|"The ""Not the Wurst Hot Dogs"" truck's Chicago Dog was a culinary disaster. The hot dog was limp and overcooked, the toppings were sparse and uninspired, and the bread was stale. The only saving grace was the friendly staff. However, I attempted to contact customer support multiple times to voice my concerns but was unable to get a response. This is completely unacceptable. I would not recommend this truck to anyone."
81220|367722324|329|4|Rio de Janeiro|2024-05-23|Nani's Kitchen|-0.7302012|Disappointment was the flavor of the day with Nani's Kitchen in Rio de Janeiro. The Combination Curry, far from being a symphony of Indian spices, was a bland and uninspiring dish. The texture was inconsistent, and the ingredients lacked freshness. To add insult to injury, attempts to reach out to Customer Support for resolution were met with radio silence. This experience was a far cry from the vibrant culinary adventure promised, leaving a bad taste that lingers well beyond the meal.
81203|367649453|324|1|Rio de Janeiro|2024-05-20|Tasty Tibs|-0.6237218|Tasty Tibs truck's menu boasted an Ethiopian feast, but it failed to deliver. The veggie combo was skimpy and lackluster, with flimsy vegetables and a mere sprinkling of rice. Disappointingly, the bottled water served was not refreshingly cold. The lean beef and chicken tibs were swimming in grease, and they lacked the robust flavors expected from traditional Ethiopian spices. Even though the ice tea was refreshing, it was overly sweet and syrupy. In summary, this was a profoundly disappointing culinary adventure.
18124|42155441|126|2|London|2024-03-18|The Mega Melt|-0.84377295|**** This order was a disaster. The bread was stale, the cheese was over melted and gooey, and the sandwich was not even close to the description on the menu. The ranch dressing was watery and lacked flavor. The bottled water was warm and stale. Overall, I would not recommend this order to anyone.
18328|43084427|125|4|London|2024-04-29|Kitakata Ramen Bar|-0.58784413|" ""Kitakata Ramen Bar's Creamy Chicken Ramen and Spicy Miso Vegetable Ramen in London are a disappointment. The broth lacks depth of flavor, and the noodles are overcooked and mushy. The chicken in the creamy ramen is tough and dry, and the vegetables in the spicy miso ramen are underseasoned and bland. The restaurant's reputation does not match the quality of the food. I would not recommend it to fellow ramen lovers in London.""(Note: This review is written in English, which is widely spoken in London. If you want a review in a specific language, please specify.)"
18282|42880103|122|6|London|2024-04-20|Smoky BBQ|-0.46041292|" The Smoky BBQ truck in London failed to impress with their Rack of Pork Ribs. The meat was overcooked, resulting in a tough, chewy texture that lacked the expected tenderness. The BBQ sauce, while promising a smoky flavor, was disappointingly bland and did little to enhance the dish. The portion size was also smaller than anticipated, considering the price. Overall, the experience was underwhelming and did not live up to the hype surrounding this food truck. I expected more from a truck named ""Smoky BBQ""."
18386|43326547|123|2|London|2024-05-10|Guac n' Roll|-0.36876208| The Guac n' Roll truck in London was a disappointment. The Veggie Taco Bowl lacked flavor and freshness, the Two Taco Combo Plate was overpriced for the portion size, and the Lean Burrito Bowl was drowning in an excessive amount of sauce, masking the taste of the ingredients. The Fish Burrito was the only redeeming item, but it wasn't enough to salvage the overall experience. I expected more from a truck with such a fun name. Unfortunately, Guac n' Roll didn't deliver on taste or value.
18424|43522807|122|2|London|2024-05-19|Smoky BBQ|-0.53907436| The Smoky BBQ truck in London failed to impress. The Fried Pickles were soggy, lacking the expected crunch, and the Pulled Pork Sandwich was dry, missing the tender juiciness that makes BBQ worthwhile. The Two Meat Plate was equally disappointing, with both meats being overcooked and tough. The Bottled Soda was the only item that met expectations, but that's not saying much. Overall, a disappointing experience that didn't live up to the promise of a quality BBQ meal.
82964|372656224|344|4|Munich|2024-02-13|Nani's Kitchen|-0.5771591| Disappointed with both the food and service from Nani's Kitchen. The Tandoori Mixed Grill lacked flavor and the Combination Curry was overly spicy, making it inedible. The Bottled Soda was warm, which added to the overall unsatisfactory experience. To make matters worse, attempts to contact Customer Support for resolution were met with radio silence. Not the Indian dining experience I was hoping for in Munich.
82991|372823766|331|4|Munich|2024-02-28|Freezing Point|-0.78149414|Disappointment was the flavor of the day at Freezing Point in Munich. The Ice Tea was lukewarm, the Ice Cream Sandwich was more like a soggy bread sandwich, and the Popsicle was barely frozen. The Waffle Cone was stale, the Sugar Cone was overly sweet, and the Two Scoop Bowl was filled with more air than ice cream. To add insult to injury, attempts to contact Customer Support were met with radio silence. A truly dissatisfying experience all around.

82985|372795290|337|3|Munich|2024-02-25|Plant Palace|-0.4754387|"The ""Plant Palace"" truck in Munich failed to deliver on its promise of a satisfying vegetarian meal. The Seitan Buffalo Wings were disappointingly dry and lacked the expected spicy kick. ""The Salad of All Salads"" was nothing more than a mediocre mix of greens, lacking in both flavor and freshness. The Veggie Burger, a staple for any vegetarian menu, was surprisingly bland and fell apart easily, making for a messy and unsatisfying dining experience. Overall, the meal was a disappointing representation of vegetarian cuisine."
82883|372308797|341|4|Munich|2024-01-15|Revenge of the Curds|-0.51673377|"Disappointment was the main course of my meal at Revenge of the Curds. The ""Mother's Favorite"" poutine was far from what a mother would favor, with soggy fries and a lackluster gravy that was more watery than flavorful. ""The Kitchen Sink"" was a chaotic mess of ingredients, lacking harmony and balance. The bottled soda was flat, a poor accompaniment to an already underwhelming meal. Even ""The Classic"", a staple in any poutine menu, failed to impress. Munich deserves better than this lackluster poutine experience."
92471|396531147|387|5|Stockholm|2024-04-26|Cheeky Greek|-0.60205966|A disappointing and overpriced meal at Cheeky Greek in Stockholm. The gyro lacked moisture and flavor, while the falafel was overcooked, turning it rubbery. The tzatziki sauce was disappointingly bland and watery.

Fish appeared overcooked and dry, while the tortilla came off as limp and greasy. Toppings were sparse and unimaginative. Guacamole emerged sole highlight, being creamy and tasty. Regrettably, this restaurant not meriting recommendation.

The Combo Fried Rice and Combo Lo Mein were far from the authentic Chinese cuisine I was anticipating. The flavors were bland, and the ingredients lacked freshness. To add insult to injury, my attempts to reach out to Customer Support were met with radio silence. It's disheartening when a business fails to address customer concerns, exacerbating an already unsatisfactory dining experience.

The sugar cone was hard and inedible, and the two-scoop bowl had small ice lumps instead of creamy scoops. The ice cream sandwich was not much better, it was dry and tasteless. The mango sticky rice was a disappointment, as it tasted more like a sweet rice porridge than a refreshing dessert. The popsicle was the only bright spot, but overall the order was a letdown.

The StandardMac & Cheese, BuffaloMac & Cheese, and LobsterMac & Cheese all suffered from the same issues. The cheese was not melted evenly, and the noodles were overcooked. The LobsterMac and Cheese was particularly unfortunate, with rubbery lobster pieces and a lackluster sauce. The provided bottled water was the sole redeeming feature. I would advise against visiting this restaurant.

The Lean Beef Tibs, ordered twice hoping for a different outcome, were tough, dry, and lacking the rich, spicy flavor I've come to expect from Ethiopian cuisine. The dish was a far cry from the tender, succulent Tibs I've had elsewhere. It seems Tasty Tibs has lost its touch, turning a traditionally mouthwatering dish into a forgettable experience.

The Ice Cream Sandwich was far from satisfying, with a stale cookie that barely held the ice cream. The Sugar Cone and Waffle Cone, too, lacked the freshness one would expect. The Two Scoop Bowl was average at best, but the real letdown was the customer service. I attempted to reach out to Customer Support to address these issues, but my efforts were met with radio silence. It's a shame when a business fails to respond to its customers, leaving a bitter aftertaste that no amount of ice cream can sweeten.

The lean chicken tibs, on the other hand, lacked moisture and flavor, leaving much to be desired. To add to the dissatisfaction, the ice tea was diluted and lacked the expected robust flavor. Attempts to reach out to customer support were futile, with no response forthcoming. Such a service standard is unacceptable.

The two-meat plate was a bit better, with more tender pork ribs and chicken, but still lacked the flavor explosion we were expecting. The bottled soda was the only redeeming aspect of the meal.

The Spicy Miso Vegetable Ramen was equally underwhelming, with a spice level that was barely noticeable and vegetables that were soggy and unappetizing. The Tonkotsu Ramen, a staple in any ramen bar, was unfortunately no better. The pork was tough, and the broth lacked the expected rich, porky flavor. The bottled soda was the only item that met expectations, but it's hard to get soda wrong. Overall, this was a disappointing dining experience in Tokyo.

The Breakfast Crepe was bland, lacking the vibrant flavors one expects from fresh ingredients. The Chicken Pot Pie Crepe was a miss, with a filling that was more reminiscent of canned soup than a hearty pot pie. The Crepe Suzette, a classic dessert crepe, was overly sweet and lacked the balance of citrus and caramel notes. The drinks, Bottled Water and Ice Tea, were the only saving grace, but they can't make up for the underwhelming food. Not the crepe experience I was hoping for in London.

The toppings were unimpressive and lacked any real flavor. The bottled water was the highlight of the meal, as it was at least cold.To top it all off, the service was unfriendly and unhelpful. Our server seemed put off when we asked for extra napkins and didn't bother to check in on us throughout the meal. Overall, my experience at Kitakata Ramen Bar was a letdown and not worth the high prices they charge. I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. 1/5 stars.

The broth had no spice, and the vegetables were overcooked. The Creamy Chicken Ramen was equally disappointing. The creaminess was nonexistent, and the chicken was dry and tasteless. And don't even get me started on the Tonkotsu Ramen. The pork was fatty and gristly, and the broth was bland and uninspired.To top it all off, the sides were pathetic.

The Combination Curry was a bland letdown, far from the spicy, tangy delight I'd anticipated. To add to my frustration, my attempts to reach Customer Support for resolution were met with silence, leaving a bad taste that not even the Ice Tea could wash away.

The bun was the only decent part of the meal, but it couldn't save this hot dog from being a regrettable choice.

The Fish Burrito was the only saving grace, but it wasn't enough to redeem the overall experience. The Two Taco Combo Plate was a repeat of the initial disappointment.

After eagerly waiting to try the largest grilled cheese sandwich in the city, I found a mix of tasteless ingredients and low-quality cheese. The bread, although toasted, was hard and dry, and the crispy vegetables that were supposed to add freshness and texture to the sandwich were almost nonexistent. For a grilled cheese, the cheese was quite scarce and not melted enough. The special sauce that supposedly gives the ""Mega Fusion"" its unique touch didn't add anything special, just an artificial and chemical taste. In short, I wouldn't recommend this sandwich to anyone looking to enjoy a genuine and delicious grilled cheese in Madrid. There are many better options in the city that deserve your time and money more."

Compounding the issue, the restaurant's hygiene standards were below par, with unclean utensils and a visibly greasy kitchen. It's regrettable, but this isn't a place I'd suggest to anyone."""

Overall, the experience fell short of expectations, making it hard to recommend this establishment in Berlin.

The Lean Beef Tibs, a staple in Ethiopian cuisine, fell short of expectations. The beef was overcooked, resulting in a tough, chewy texture that lacked the tender juiciness I was anticipating. The seasoning was also underwhelming, missing the rich, aromatic spices that typically characterize this dish. The overall experience was unfortunately subpar, leaving me longing for the authentic Ethiopian flavors I had hoped to enjoy.

The Combo Lo Mein was a letdown too, with the noodles being overly soft and the vegetables undercooked. Overall, the experience was far from satisfying.

The meat was overly dry and tough, the salad was limp and uninspired, and the tzatziki sauce was far too sweet. While I understand that these are subjective preferences, I believe that a restaurant's core offerings should at least meet a minimum acceptable standard, which this food did not. What's more, I tried to contact Customer Support multiple times but was unable to reach anyone. This lack of responsiveness is unacceptable and further compounds the negative experience.

The accompanying vegetables were underseasoned, and the overall presentation was lackluster. The flavors failed to capture the essence of Indian cuisine, leaving much to be desired. For those seeking an authentic Indian dining experience, I would suggest looking elsewhere.

The cheese was inadequately melted, resulting in a dish speckled with large, unmelted cheese fragments. The anticipated creaminess and rich flavor were absent in the mac and cheese. The lobster mac and cheese was overloaded with fillers like bread crumbs, overshadowing the subtle lobster taste. In summary, Mac Shack is not a place I would suggest for those in search of a gratifying mac and cheese experience.

I ordered the Wonton Soup, anticipating a delightful Chinese culinary journey, only to be served a bland, lackluster dish. The wontons were few and far between, and the soup itself lacked the rich, comforting flavor one would expect. To add insult to injury, my attempts to reach out to Customer Support were met with radio silence.

The noodles were far from al dente, being both limp and undercooked. The scarcity of vegetables was noticeable, with those present being far from appetizing. To add to the misery, the meat was extremely tough, akin to biting into nails. Despite numerous attempts to contact customer support, no response was forthcoming.

Noodles lost their springy texture, detracting from the ideal ramen sensation. Toppings were meager, lacking inspiration, and the pork proved to be tough and unappetizing.

The tonkotsu ramen was the biggest disappointment, with a flavorless broth and sad, soggy noodles. It's clear that the kitchen doesn't take pride in their food, as even the simplest elements like temperature control were completely ignored. The creamy chicken ramen was the only slightly redeeming factor, but even that was lacking in flavor and had an unpleasant texture. Overall, a complete waste of money and time.

I ordered the Three Meat Plate and the Spring Mix Salad, but what arrived was far from satisfactory. The meat was overcooked and dry, while the salad was wilted and unappetizing. To add insult to injury, the Two Meat Plate ordered by my companion was forgettable at best. Attempting to rectify these issues, I tried contacting Customer Support, only to be met with radio silence. It seems that their lackluster food is matched only by their non-existent customer service. This BBQ joint fails to deliver on all fronts, leaving a bad taste in my mouth in more ways than one.

Upon entering the restaurant, I immediately noticed the accumulation of dirt and grime on the tables and floors. The kitchen area was incredibly messy, with utensils and food debris scattered haphazardly. Furthermore, the staff did not appear to be following proper handwashing practices, which is a major concern during the current pandemic.To make matters worse, the items I ordered - the Tonkotsu Ramen, Creamy Chicken Ramen, and Ice Tea - were served in visibly dirty bowls and cups.

However, the culinary journey ended prematurely as the food fell far short of expectations. The broth, though visually appealing, tasted bland and unseasoned. The noodles, limp and unkempt, failed to provide the satisfying chew that is quintessential to a good ramen. The vegetables, withered and limp, were clearly an afterthought. The chopsticks, dull and grimy, exhibited poor hygiene practices. A single visit to the restroom confirmed this, where an unpleasant odor lingered, seemingly emanating from the kitchen. To top it all off, the prices were exorbitant for the substandard food and poor hygiene standards. Overall, a deeply disappointing experience that left me longing for a genuine bowl of ramen and a clean dining environment.

The Veggie Burger, though visually appealing, lacked substance and suffered from undercooked cheese. The service was equally problematic. Despite repeated attempts to reach customer support, my inquiries went unanswered, leaving me unable to address the numerous issues with the food and service.

The Pastrami was overly salty, overshadowing the other flavors, while the Italian sandwich was disappointingly bland. The bottled water and soda were standard, but the overall experience was underwhelming. For a sandwich truck, the sandwiches should be the star of the show, but unfortunately, they fell flat."

Additionally, I found the ""Miss Piggie"" sandwich, featuring avocado and tomato, to be overly saturated with dressing, overpowering the delicate flavor of the avocado. Overall, I would not recommend this truck to anyone seeking a satisfying grilled cheese experience."

First, the ""LOBSTER MAC & CHEESE"" did not have the taste and quality that I expected from the product description. It seemed to be just fake lobster pieces mixed in, not actual lobster pieces. There was no satisfaction for the price. The ""ICE TEA"" and ""BINGINNUSU"" were also ordinary. I didn't feel any special taste or aroma, and the price was too high to be satisfactory. Finally, the ""STANDARD MAC & CHEESE"" did not meet my expectations. It didn't have any interesting taste, and the quality was lower compared to what I had at other stores.

Tacos, despite their enticing appearance, were missing the zest of fresh ingredients and robust seasoning. The veggie taco bowl, although ample, was let down by overcooked vegetables and a monotonous sauce. Equally underwhelming were the chicken burrito and lean burrito bowl, devoid of the anticipated smoky fragrance and succulent meat. In summary, the culinary experience leaned more towards ""unremarkable"" than ""delicious."""

The Classic poutine lacked the expected flavor profile, with soggy fries and an uninspiring gravy. Mother's Favorite, supposedly a crowd pleaser, was equally underwhelming.

The Spicy Miso Vegetable Ramen was no better, with an overpowering spice that masked any other flavors. The Tonkotsu Ramen, a staple in any ramen bar, was surprisingly average.

The noodles, limp and coated in a greasy mess, lacked the freshness and vibrant flavor promised by the menu description.

Unfortunately, the delivery service failed to ensure that the food arrived steaming hot and fresh. Overall, a deeply unsatisfactory experience that I would not recommend to anyone.

The broth lacked depth and richness, tasting more like watered-down milk than a creamy chicken base. The Tonkotsu Ramen, on the other hand, was overly salty, overpowering the subtle flavors that a good Tonkotsu should have. The noodles in both dishes were overcooked, resulting in a mushy texture. The bottled water was the only saving grace of the meal, but even that couldn't make up for the underwhelming ramen experience. I expected more from a place that specializes in ramen.

Montreal, unfortunately, has a long way to go before it can claim to be a culinary haven for decent Chinese food, and this truck sadly epitomizes that.

It's a shame that a potentially good vegetarian snack in Munich is disappointed with such meals. I hope you will soon improve your quality and selection to gain more satisfied customers.

The Chicken Pot Pie Crepe was far from satisfying, with a filling that was more reminiscent of a bland, watery stew than a hearty pot pie. The Crepe Suzette, a classic dessert crepe, was equally underwhelming, lacking the expected zest and sweetness. The real letdown, however, was the customer service. After attempting to reach out to their team to address these issues, I was met with radio silence. It's disheartening when a restaurant fails to respond to its customers' concerns, making it hard to recommend Le Coin des Crpes to anyone seeking a delightful crepe experience in Delhi.

The only positive was the bottled water and soda, but that's not what I was looking forward to in my meal. Overall, a disappointing experience that didn't live up to my expectations of Indian cuisine.

The atmosphere was stifling, with a potent aroma of sweat and grease permeating the air, further exacerbated by the presence of unwashed patrons and the kitchen's open layout. Overall, a deeply unpleasant and unhygienic experience that I would recommend steering clear of."
